                            <p>I am the immediate past editor of the Chambers USA Guide and its longest-serving editor. During my tenure overseeing the guide, the level of participation increased by 30%, reaching just under 11,000 submissions, thanks in part to my drive to improve transparency in the research process and my desire to help firms improve their submissions.</p>
                            <p>I would now like to take my extensive knowledge of the guides and the legal market, and the experience I gained sharing best practice insights, to work more closely with firms to improve their performance in and understanding of directories like Chambers and Legal 500.</p>
                            <p>While the bulk of my time has been on the USA Guide, I have worked across the whole family of Chambers Guides, covering major centers of economic and legal activity around the world. I am familiar with all areas of business law covered in the directories, so will waste no time in understanding your firm's work.</p>
                            <p>I am a dual US/UK citizen, originally from Buffalo, NY and have now been living in London for over ten years. I have a BA in History and Middle Eastern Studies from the University of Pittsburgh and an MA in Middle Eastern Studies from the School of Oriental and African Studies â€“ University of London.</p>
